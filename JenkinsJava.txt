HelloWorld.java 
// HelloWorld.java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}

Step 2: Compile and Run Locally
1- Save the above code in a file named HelloWorld.java.
2- Open your terminal or command prompt.
3- Navigate to the directory where the HelloWorld.java file is saved.
javac HelloWorld.java
java HelloWorld

Step 3: Set Up Jenkins
1- Install Jenkins

2- Create a New Job:

Open Jenkins in your web browser (http://localhost:8080 by default).

Click on New Item.

3- Configure the Job:

In the job configuration page, scroll down to the Build section.
Select Add build step and choose Execute Windows batch command 

4- Enter Build Commands:

In the command box, enter the following commands to compile and run the Java program:
echo "Building Java Application"
javac HelloWorld.java
java HelloWorld

5- Save the job

Step 4: Execute the Job
1-Go back to the main Jenkins dashboard.
2-Click on your job (JavaHelloWorld).
3-Click on Build Now to execute the job.
4-Once the build is complete, click on the build number (e.g., #1) to view the console output.


open that #number from build history
go to console output
paste the file in that directory
